Migration strategy development tools
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This section will provide a guidance when migrating from an arbitrary project tooling state, to the
recommended tooling for exasol python project(s).

.. note::

    Generally the described steps should be seen as individual iterations of the migration (one "tool" at the time).
    In theory they mostly can be applied in arbitrary order, but most of the times it will make your life
    easier if you migrate in the suggested order.
