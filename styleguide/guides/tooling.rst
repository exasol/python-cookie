_____________
Unifying basic tooling removes overall complexity when dealing with multiple projects.

* Reduces on-boarding of new people into the project(s)
* Reduces cognitive overhead when switching between projects

  * Running Test, Build is the same in "every"  project e.g. `nox -s test`
  * Developers are more likely to develop deep knowledge of the tools

* Reduces the potential of errors and misuse
* Increases potential for automation (checks, automated fixes, etc.)
* Decreases complexity of automation
