Summary
+++++++
Issue tracking is a great tool to track pending work and improve the overall communication within a project.
But similar to every other tool, it needs to be used appropriately.

    | "A fool with a tool is still a fool"
    | -- Grady Booch

This guide will try to help you to get the best out of the issue tracking for you, your teammates and the project,
by answering the following questions:

* When to create an issue
* What makes a good issue
* How to maintain an issue
* How to maintain a the backlog (grooming)

When to create an issue
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Let me start by saying there is no *100%* complete ruleset to decide this question, otherwise there would be some code doing that for us.
Reality is fuzzy, but that's also  why humans are quite good in deciding fuzzy things. So instead of trying to describe
a complete ruleset to decide this question, this section will help you, jump start your decision making proces for this question.
