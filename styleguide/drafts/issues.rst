What makes a good issue?
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Like a good/bad book/website not only about the amount of the content rather on how well
it is organized cross references and the quality and understandability of the text ...
Whatever helps the reader links, media, external references. Still be preceise
sweet spot ... life and humans stuff even gets maintained or it gets broken, broken
tickets create more work than they do good. ruin vs level ground for building something new

* Importance of a good ticket grows with the time it will stay on hold/wait unitl it gets addressed
* Context is King
* "clear" scope & goals
    - e.g. task list
