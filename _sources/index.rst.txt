Welcome to the Exasol_ python-styleguide.
The styleguide(s) is not intend to be a universal text on how to do each single detail in python,
it rather tries to reley on existing documents, guides and references them (e.g. pep8_).
This guide(s) rather will add useful additions or exceptions where Exasol_ is deverging from the *"norm"* and why.
