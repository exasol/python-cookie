Sphinx
+++++++
`Project Homepage <Sphinx_www_>`_

Sphinx is widely used within the python space and outside of it, because it is very powerful.
Admittedly it's powerfulness comes with a cost of complexity for bigger setups.
Still the overall the benefits outweigh the cost, and with the detail in mind that
lots of projects are using sphinx it is worth the effort to learn and use it.

sphinx-github-pages-generator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`Project Homepage <sphinx-github-pages-generator_www_>`_

Once various versions of a project are published, different users of the project use different versions of it.
Therefore the need to consult different versions of the project documentation arises.
The *sphinx-github-pages-generator* addresses this issue by generating documentation for all the different versions
in one place.
